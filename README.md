# odin-recipes
This is the first project in TOP curriculum
It's based on the fundamentals of HTML
It's a Recipes website, where I'm supposed to apply what I've learnt so far about HTML headings, patragraphs, links, images...

The project is composed of 4 pages, a home page and 3 recipes' pages.

Pages Description:
------------------
  The home page shows the project title and links to recipes.
  Each recipe page contains the title of the recipe, its image and description, as well as the ingredients and steps to make it.
